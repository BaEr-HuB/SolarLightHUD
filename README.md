# SolarLightHUD
A clean HUD for TF2.

This is a WIP, so expect to see some remnants of the stock HUD and some unfinished elements.

Please disable minmode, as it is not supported.

# June 11th 2018 Update

* Respawn text is moved to a location where, hopefully, it will no longer overlap other elements.
* Removed all instances of Minmode having effects on modified parts of the HUD. This hopefully prevents MANY bugs from occuring when it is enabled, including a case where the Target ID cut off (hiding the uber/disguise label in the process)
* Added support for floating health. Fixed TargetIDs breaking when floating health is enabled. Thank you for the heads up, Pink.

Known issues: Medal on main menu still does not like being on anything besides 16:9. Minmode may still affect any remaining default parts of the HUD that are applicable.

More updates will come soon with the possibility of UI improvements
